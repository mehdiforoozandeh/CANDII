# candi — bake: ENCODE-style directory -> HDF5 (schema v2). Pure IO + numpy; no GPU compute.
# Env preamble copied from sandbox/diagnostics/dual_conditioning_real/jobs/wd0.sh (the recorded jobs).
# Directory is slurm/ and NOT jobs/ on purpose — .gitignore:15 has an unanchored `jobs/` rule that
# would silently swallow these scripts (same for models/, logs/).
#
# WHY --gres ON A CPU-ONLY JOB: submitted without it, this routes to the def-maxwl_cpu account, whose
# fairshare is 0.088 vs def-maxwl_gpu's 0.435. Combined with the standing maintenance reservations
# (CDUMaintenance2 alone holds 432 nodes), a 2-core/30G bake lands at rank ~875/876 in
# cpubase_bycore_b1 (876 pending vs 20 running) and effectively never starts. Requesting the smallest
# MIG slice routes it through the GPU account instead, where this project's jobs actually run. The slice
# is idle for the ~20 min the bake takes; that is the intended trade. Drop --gres if the CPU queue
# recovers. Never use any other gres spec (project hard rule).
#   sbatch candi/slurm/bake.sh
# Logs go to ./slurm-logs/ RELATIVE TO WHERE YOU SUBMIT FROM. SLURM resolves --output against
# the submitting cwd, not the script's location, so `mkdir -p slurm-logs` first (or pass
# `sbatch --output=... --error=...` to override). Submitting from anywhere is then fine.

# type2 loci: the recorded q19 anchors were measured on an h5 of 7,485 windows = 5,485 type1 (chr19
# 3,053 train + chr21 2,432 eval) PLUS 2,000 type2 (1,000 cCRE + 1,000 non-cCRE sampled across the
# other chromosomes). Baking with --type2-* 0 reproduces the type1 core exactly but drops those 2,000,
# which makes the run non-comparable to the anchors. Keep 1000/1000 to reproduce; set both to 0 for a
# faster chr19-only run, and then do NOT compare the result to the recorded numbers.
# --allow-missing-control: B_DND-41 carries ONLY ATAC-seq and DNase-seq — accessibility assays, which
# need no ChIP input control — so it has no chipseq-control/ directory at all and its control channel is
# the MISSING(-1) sentinel in every window. The F15 gate is correct to stop on this by default (a silently
# absent control IS a capability loss for a ChIP panel); here it is the real structure of the data, and
# the original sandbox.h5 bake stored the identical -1 sentinel. Note this contradicts the "control is
# always available" invariant stated in the project docs. Re-check F15 output whenever the panel changes.
