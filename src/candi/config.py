"""Encoder configuration.

Provenance: EncoderConfig is a VERBATIM copy of EpiDenoise/sandbox/candi_v2/config.py:30-76.
DecoderConfig / CANDIv2TrainingConfig / CANDIv2Config / validate_v2_config are not shipped.

Note: num_metadata_rows (4) and num_runtypes (2) are deliberately NOT fields here. They are
fixed by the ingestion contract and fenced by asserts in encoder.MetadataEmbedding.forward.
